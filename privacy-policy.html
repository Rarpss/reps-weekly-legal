  <h1>Reps Weekly Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 9, 2026</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Downloading and using our mobile application (Reps Weekly)</li>
    <li>Using any related apps or services linked to this Privacy Notice</li>
    <li>Participating in marketing, events, or sales-related activities (if any)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Purpose of Reps Weekly:</strong> Reps Weekly is a fitness tracking app designed to help users log bodyweight exercises, visualize progress, manage difficulty, and stay motivated. It includes optional team-based features for social engagement.</p>

  <p><strong>Questions or Concerns?</strong><br>
  If you have any questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:repsweekly@gmail.com">repsweekly@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Summary of Key Points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What Information Do We Process?</strong> We process personal data based on your interactions with Reps Weekly, including the features you use and the information you voluntarily provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Do We Process Sensitive Data?</strong> No. We do not intentionally process sensitive data like racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.</li>
    <li><strong>Do We Collect Data From Third Parties?</strong> No, we generally collect personal data directly from you, and from service providers that help operate the app (e.g., Firebase, AdMob).</li>
    <li><strong>How Do We Use Your Data?</strong> We use it to provide and improve the app, secure your account, prevent fraud, support team features you choose to use, and comply with law.</li>
    <li><strong>Who Might We Share It With?</strong> We may share data with trusted service providers (e.g., Firebase, AdMob). If you join a team, limited profile and progress data may be visible to teammates (details below).</li>
    <li><strong>How Is Your Info Protected?</strong> We use industry-standard safeguards. However, no transmission or storage method is 100% secure.</li>
    <li><strong>What Are Your Rights?</strong> Privacy rights vary based on location (e.g., GDPR in EU/UK). You can submit access or deletion requests via email.</li>
    <li><strong>Do We Use Advertising?</strong> Yes. We use Google AdMob to serve ads, which may process device and usage data to deliver and measure ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Remote Configuration?</strong> Yes. We use Firebase Remote Config to adjust app settings and behavior to improve stability and user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

  <h3>Personal Information You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address (for account login and account management)</li>
    <li>Username</li>
    <li>Workout data (reps, exercise types, difficulty selection, progress)</li>
    <li>Profile settings (e.g., preferences)</li>
    <li>Team affiliation (if you choose to join or create a team)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Please ensure your information is accurate and up to date. If you contact us for support, we may process the information you provide to resolve the issue.</p>

  <p>We rely on secure infrastructure provided by Firebase to manage authentication, data storage, and app integrity features such as App Check. We use Firebase services including (as applicable) Authentication, Firestore Database, Remote Config, App Check, and related cloud infrastructure to operate Reps Weekly.</p>

  <h3>Team and Social Features</h3>
  <p>If you choose to join or create a team, limited profile information such as your username, avatar, and aggregated workout progress (e.g., percentages, completed days, or team totals) may be visible to other team members. Detailed account information (such as your email address) is not shared with other users.</p>
  <p>User-generated content (such as team names and usernames) may be moderated and removed if it violates our standards or applicable law.</p>

  <h3>Advertising Data (Google AdMob)</h3>
  <p>We use Google AdMob to serve ads within the Reps Weekly app. AdMob may process device and usage data such as IP address, device identifiers, approximate location (inferred from IP, where allowed), ad interaction data, and diagnostic/performance data to deliver, optimize, and measure ad performance.</p>
  <p>Ads may be personalized or non-personalized depending on your device settings, consent choices (where required), and regional regulations. Learn more at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google’s Advertising Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

  <h3>iOS App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and IDFA</h3>
  <p>On iOS devices, Reps Weekly complies with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. If we seek to access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for advertising measurement or personalization, iOS requires user permission. If you decline permission (or if permission is not requested), the IDFA is not accessed. Ads will still be shown, but may be less relevant.</p>

  <h3>Analytics and Performance (Optional)</h3>
  <p>We may collect anonymized or aggregated performance and diagnostic information (such as crash data or basic usage metrics) to improve app stability and user experience. Where used, this data is intended to be non-identifying or minimized to what is necessary for app improvement.</p>

  <h3>Application Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Local notifications and reminder preferences (stored locally on your device)</li>
    <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    <li>Internal diagnostics and performance metrics (where enabled)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notification Scheduling</h3>
  <p>Reps Weekly uses local device data (such as timezone and user preferences) to schedule notifications. These reminders are designed to support consistent training habits and are stored locally on your device. Notification permissions are requested explicitly, and you may opt out at any time via your device settings.</p>
  <p>We do not transmit notification content to external servers, and no notification data is shared with other users or third parties. Scheduled notifications are suppressed automatically if permission is denied or revoked.</p>

  <h3>Remote Configuration</h3>
  <p>Reps Weekly uses Firebase Remote Config to dynamically adjust app configuration values (such as feature flags, limits, or settings) to improve stability, performance, and user experience. Remote Config is not intended to collect personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h3>Sensitive Info</h3>
  <p>We do not intentionally collect or process sensitive personal information.</p>

  <h3>Google API</h3>
  <p>Use of Google APIs follows the Google API Services User Data Policy, including limited use provisions (if applicable).</p>

    <li>Communicate with you as needed (e.g., support)</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud and secure the platform (e.g., App Check)</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
    <li>Serve advertising via Google AdMob, including delivering, optimizing, and measuring ads</li>

  <p><strong>If You Are in the EU or UK:</strong><br> We process your data under the following legal bases (as applicable):</p>

    <li>Legitimate Interests (e.g., securing and improving the app, preventing fraud), where permitted</li>
    <li>Vital Interests (to protect safety in emergency cases)</li>
  </ul>

  <section id="adConsent">
    <p><strong>Advertising and Consent:</strong><br>
    Advertising-related processing may be conducted on the basis of your consent, which you can manage via device settings and, where implemented, in-app consent mechanisms. This includes ad personalization controls provided by mobile operating systems (e.g., Android, iOS) and any applicable consent prompts required by regional regulations.</p>
  </section>

  <p><strong>If You Are in Canada:</strong><br> Processing may occur through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Express or implied consent</li>
    <li>Exceptions under Canadian law (where applicable), such as fraud detection or legal requirements</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> advertising delivery, measurement, and performance</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Team sharing (only if you join a team):</strong> Your username, avatar, and aggregated progress statistics may be visible to other members of your team.</p>

    <li>Comply with applicable legal requirements</li>
    <li>Resolve disputes and enforce agreements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once we no longer need your data:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>If a universal standard is adopted in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy</li>
