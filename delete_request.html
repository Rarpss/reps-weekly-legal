    <h1>Request Account & Data Deletion</h1>
    <p>This page is provided by <strong>Reps Weekly</strong> to help users request deletion of their account and associated data.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Quick summary:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Email us from the email address linked to your Reps Weekly account (recommended).</li>
        <li>We’ll confirm your request and then delete eligible data.</li>
        <li>If information is missing, we’ll reply asking for what we need to verify ownership.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>How to Request Deletion</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Email our support team with the subject line: <strong><code>Delete My Account</code></strong></li>
      <li>Include:
        <ul>
          <li>The email address associated with your Reps Weekly account</li>
          <li>(Optional) Your UID from the app (if available in your Profile screen)</li>
          <li>(Optional) A short note confirming you want your account deleted</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Send your request to: <strong><a href="mailto:repsweekly@gmail.com">repsweekly@gmail.com</a></strong></li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note small">
      <strong>Verification:</strong> To protect users, we may need to verify ownership before processing deletion.
      The fastest method is emailing us from the account’s registered email address.
      If you no longer have access to that email, we may ask for additional information to confirm you own the account.
    </div>

    <h2>What Gets Deleted</h2>
    <p>When a valid deletion request is confirmed, we will delete (or de-identify where appropriate) account-related data such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account profile information (such as email associated with authentication)</li>
      <li>Your user identifier (UID) and account records used to access the app</li>
      <li>Workout history, including rep counts and timestamps stored against your account</li>
      <li>Progress tracking and performance metrics stored against your account</li>
      <li>Account-linked preferences or feature flags stored against your account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What May Be Retained</h2>
    <p>Some information may be retained only as needed for legitimate purposes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emails you send to support (we may retain support communications for recordkeeping)</li>
      <li>Security, fraud prevention, and abuse monitoring records (where required or reasonably necessary)</li>
      <li>Aggregated or de-identified analytics that cannot reasonably be used to identify you</li>
      <li>Data we are required to keep to comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Target deletion timeframe:</strong> We aim to complete deletion within <strong>7 days</strong> after confirming your request.
      In some cases (for example, if verification is required), processing may take longer.
    </p>
